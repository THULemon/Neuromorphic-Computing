# Neuromorphic Computing

Many works towards **Neurmorphic Computing** have published in devices, circuits, architecture, and algorithms. However, these works are disperse and there are not a unitive review for reaseachers in this field. The **Neurmorphic Computing** project aims to collect the works in neuromorphic/ neuro-inspired computing field to help the researchers to find the information easily. The information is collected from the internet and this project is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis.

This project is started by Tsinghua's [LEMON](http://stor.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn) Group.

## Overview

## Devices

Neuromorphic computing with novel memory devices has attracted considerable attention. Tremendous efforts have been made to implement artificial neurons and artificial synapses using a variety of emerging devices, such as phase-change memory (PCM), Mott memristor, resistive random-access memory (RRAM), magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), conductive-bridge random-access memory(CBRAM), ferroelectric Ô¨Åeld-effect transistors(FeFET). The neuron-like integrate-and-fire behaviors are usually realized by the threshold switching characteristics of these devices, while the synaptic weight changes in artificial synapses are modulated by means of analog nonvolatile switching onto different levels of resistance (or conductance). Consequently, these emerging devices have attracted significant attention in the past decade as a key enabler of new computing paradigms.

There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The CIFAR-100 dataset dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
5. [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/): ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.
