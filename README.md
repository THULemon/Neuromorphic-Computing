# Neuromorphic Computing

Many works towards **Neurmorphic Computing** have published in devices, circuits, architecture, and algorithms. However, these works are disperse and there are not a unitive review for reaseachers in this field. The **Neurmorphic Computing** project aims to collect the works in neuromorphic/ neuro-inspired computing field to help the researchers to find the information easily. The information is collected from the internet and this project is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis.

This project is started by Tsinghua's [LEMON](http://stor.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn) Group.

### Dataset and Benchmark

1. [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist): The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
2. [CIFAR](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html): The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The CIFAR-100 dataset dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
3. [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/): ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.
