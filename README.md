# Neuromorphic Computing

Many works towards **Neurmorphic Computing** have published in devices, circuits, architecture, and algorithms. However, these works are disperse and there are not a unitive review for reaseachers in this field. The **Neurmorphic Computing** project aims to collect the works in neuromorphic/ neuro-inspired computing field to help the researchers to find the information easily. The information is collected from the internet and this project is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis.

This project is started by Tsinghua's [LEMON](http://stor.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn) Group.

### Dataset and Benchmark

1. [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist): The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
2. [MNIST-DVS](http://www2.imse-cnm.csic.es/caviar/MNISTDVS.html): The MNIST-DVS database consists of a set of 30,000 DVS recordings of different handwritten digits. A total of 10,000 original 28x28 pixel handwritten digit images from MNIST were upscaled using smoothing interpolation algorithms to three different scales. Each upscaled digit was then displayed on an LCD monitor with slow motion and a 128x128 pixel DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor) was used to record the moving digits.
3. [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/): SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting.
4. [CIFAR](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html): The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The CIFAR-100 dataset dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
5. [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/): ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.
6. [Microsoft's COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#overview): COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
