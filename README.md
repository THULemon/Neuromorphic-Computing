# Neuromorphic Computing

Many works towards **Neurmorphic Computing** have published in devices, circuits, architecture, and algorithms. However, these works are disperse and there are not a unitive review for reaseachers in this field. The **Neurmorphic Computing** project aims to collect the works in neuromorphic/ neuro-inspired computing field to help the researchers to find the information. The information is collected from the internet and this project is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis.

This project is started by Tsinghua's [LEMON](http://stor.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn) Group.
